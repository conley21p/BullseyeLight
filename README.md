# BullseyeLight
This is a project from 2020, I used a ultrasonic radar to measure if the dart hit the bullseye. 

The code is setup with one radar, if you set this up two radars it would improve the accuraccy a lot.
If you were to use more than one radar though, you would have to set them up so they don't interfere with each other.
